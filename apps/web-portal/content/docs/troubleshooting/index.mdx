## Quick Tips

- Make sure the Speak for Me bot is **invited to the channel** where you want suggestions
- Use `/speakforme-watch` in a channel to start receiving suggestions there
- Ephemeral messages (suggestions) are only visible to you and disappear when you reload Slack
- Check the [dashboard](/dashboard) for your current usage and subscription status
