## Bot Is Not Responding to Messages

**Cause:** The bot may not be watching the conversation, or it may not be invited to the channel.

**Solution:**

1. In the Slack channel, type `/watch` to start watching that conversation
2. If you get an error, make sure the Speak for Me bot is invited to the channel by typing `/invite @Speak for Me`
3. Verify the conversation appears in your [watched conversations list](/dashboard) on the web portal
4. Check that your subscription is active and you have not exceeded your monthly suggestion limit

<Callout type="warn">
  The bot only generates suggestions for conversations you have explicitly watched using the `/watch` command. It does not monitor all channels automatically.
</Callout>

## Suggestions Are Not Appearing

**Cause:** Suggestions may not trigger for every message. The bot looks for messages directed at you or mentioning you in watched conversations.

**Solution:**

1. Confirm the conversation is being watched (check the dashboard or use `/watch` again)
2. Make sure the bot is a member of the channel
3. Verify you have not reached your monthly suggestion limit
4. Check that the message was from another person (the bot does not generate suggestions for your own messages)
5. Wait a few seconds; suggestions are generated asynchronously and may take a moment to appear

## Cannot Sign In to the Web Portal

**Cause:** Authentication issues are usually related to cookies or Slack workspace membership.

**Solution:**

1. Clear your browser cookies for the Speak for Me website
2. Try signing in again using the **Sign in with Slack** button
3. Make sure you are a member of a Slack workspace where Speak for Me is installed
4. Try using a different browser or incognito/private window
5. If you recently changed your Slack account, you may need to re-authorize the app

## Style Changes Are Not Taking Effect

**Cause:** Style preference changes apply to the next suggestion generated, not retroactively.

**Solution:**

1. Update your style preferences on the [dashboard](/dashboard)
2. Save your changes
3. The next suggestion generated will use your updated preferences
4. Previous suggestions are not regenerated with new style settings

<Callout type="info">
  Style changes (tone, formality, preferred phrases) are applied in real-time to new suggestions. There is no delay beyond the next triggering message.
</Callout>

## Weekly Report Not Generating

**Cause:** Weekly reports require proper configuration and an active Pro subscription.

**Solution:**

1. Verify you have an active **Pro** plan (weekly reports are a Pro feature)
2. Check your report settings on the [dashboard](/dashboard) under **Reports**
3. Ensure the report schedule is **enabled** and the day/time are configured
4. If using Google Sheets export, verify your Google account is connected
5. Check that the recipient channel or DM is configured correctly

## Ephemeral Messages Disappeared

**Cause:** This is expected behavior. Ephemeral messages in Slack are temporary by design.

**Solution:**

Ephemeral messages (the way Speak for Me delivers suggestions) are only visible to you and are not stored permanently in the channel. They disappear when you:

- Reload Slack
- Switch to a different workspace
- Close and reopen Slack

This is a Slack platform limitation, not a Speak for Me issue. Your suggestion history is preserved on the [web portal dashboard](/dashboard) if you need to reference past suggestions.

<Callout type="info">
  Ephemeral messages are private by design. No one else in the channel can see your suggestions. This is intentional for privacy.
</Callout>

## Google Sheets Export Not Working

**Cause:** The Google Sheets integration may need re-authorization or the connected spreadsheet may have issues.

**Solution:**

1. Go to the [dashboard](/dashboard) and check your Google Sheets connection status
2. If disconnected, click **Connect Google Sheets** to re-authorize
3. Verify the spreadsheet you selected still exists and you have edit access
4. Check that you have not exceeded the rate limit (30 writes per minute)
5. Try disconnecting and reconnecting the Google Sheets integration
