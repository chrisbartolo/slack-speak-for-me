This page helps you resolve common billing and subscription issues with Speak for Me.

---

## Payment Failed

**Cause:** Your credit card was declined or expired.

**Solution:**

1. Sign in to the [dashboard](/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **Billing** settings
3. Click **Manage Billing** to open the Stripe Customer Portal
4. Update your payment method with a valid credit card
5. Stripe will automatically retry the failed payment

<Callout type="info">
  Stripe retries failed payments up to 3 times over several days. Your subscription remains active during the retry period. If all retries fail, your subscription is paused.
</Callout>

---

## Trial Expired

**Cause:** Your 14-day free trial has ended and no payment method was added.

**Solution:**

1. Sign in to the [dashboard](/dashboard)
2. Navigate to the **Pricing** page
3. Select a plan (Starter or Pro) and complete payment
4. Your subscription activates immediately and all features are restored

Your data (style preferences, person context, conversation context) is preserved when your trial expires. You do not lose any configuration.

## Charged Incorrectly

**Cause:** Unexpected charges may be due to seat count changes, plan upgrades, or proration.

**Solution:**

1. Check your invoice in the Stripe Customer Portal (accessible from **Billing** in the dashboard)
2. Review the line items for proration charges (partial-month adjustments when changing plans)
3. Verify the seat count matches your expected number of team members
4. If you believe there is a billing error, contact support at [support@speakforme.app](mailto:support@speakforme.app) with your invoice number

<Callout type="warn">
  Plan upgrades are prorated, meaning you pay the difference for the remaining days in your billing period. Downgrades take effect at the end of the current billing period.
</Callout>

## Individual vs. Organization Billing Confusion

**Cause:** You may have both an individual subscription and be part of an organization with a team plan.

**Solution:**

If you belong to an organization with an active team plan:

1. The **organization plan takes precedence** over your individual subscription
2. You do not need a separate individual subscription
3. To cancel your individual subscription, go to **Billing** in the dashboard and click **Manage Billing**
4. Cancel the individual subscription through the Stripe Customer Portal

If you are unsure which billing applies to you:

1. Check your [dashboard](/dashboard) for your current plan status
2. The plan name will indicate whether it is an individual plan or a team plan
3. Contact your organization admin if you have questions about team billing

---

## Subscription Shows "Past Due"

**Cause:** A payment failed and Stripe is retrying.

**Solution:**

1. Update your payment method as described in the [Payment Failed](#payment-failed) section above
2. Stripe will automatically retry the charge
3. Your subscription remains active during the retry period (typically 3-7 days)
4. If the payment is not resolved, the subscription will be paused

---

## Cannot Access Pro Features

**Cause:** Your subscription may not be active, or you may be on the wrong plan tier.

**Solution:**

1. Check your current plan on the [dashboard](/dashboard)
2. Verify the subscription status shows **active** or **trialing**
3. If your status shows **canceled** or **past_due**, follow the steps above to resolve
4. If you recently upgraded, try signing out and back in to refresh your session
