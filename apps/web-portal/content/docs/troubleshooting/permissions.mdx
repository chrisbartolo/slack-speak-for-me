This guide explains the permissions Speak for Me requires, what each scope does, and how to resolve common permission-related issues.

## Slack App Permissions

Speak for Me requires the following Slack OAuth scopes to function:

### Bot Scopes

| Scope | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `channels:history` | Read messages in public channels the bot is invited to |
| `channels:read` | View basic information about public channels |
| `chat:write` | Send ephemeral suggestions to users |
| `commands` | Register and handle slash commands (`/watch`, `/unwatch`, `/generate-report`) |
| `groups:history` | Read messages in private channels the bot is invited to |
| `groups:read` | View basic information about private channels |
| `im:history` | Read direct message conversations |
| `im:read` | View basic information about DMs |
| `mpim:history` | Read group direct message conversations |
| `mpim:read` | View basic information about group DMs |
| `users:read` | Look up user names and profile information |
| `users:read.email` | Access user email addresses for billing identity |

### User Scopes

| Scope | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `identity.basic` | Sign in with Slack (web portal authentication) |
| `identity.email` | Access your email for account identification |
| `identity.team` | Identify which workspace you belong to |

<Callout type="info">
  Speak for Me only reads messages in channels where the bot has been explicitly invited. It cannot access channels it has not been added to.
</Callout>

## Common Permission Issues

### Bot Cannot See Messages in a Channel

**Cause:** The bot has not been invited to the channel.

**Solution:**

1. Open the Slack channel where you want suggestions
2. Type `/invite @Speak for Me` to add the bot to the channel
3. Once invited, use `/watch` to start watching the conversation
4. The bot can now see messages in that channel and generate suggestions

<Callout type="warn">
  For private channels, a channel member must invite the bot. The bot cannot join private channels on its own.
</Callout>

### Cannot Install the App

**Cause:** Installing Slack apps typically requires admin-level permissions in the workspace.

**Solution:**

1. Check if your Slack workspace has **app approval** enabled (Settings > Manage Apps)
2. If app approval is enabled, you may need to request approval from a workspace admin
3. If you are a workspace admin, visit the [install page](/install) and authorize the app
4. For Enterprise Grid workspaces, the app may need to be approved at the organization level

### Web Portal Shows "Unauthorized"

**Cause:** Your Slack session may have expired or your workspace membership changed.

**Solution:**

1. Click **Sign Out** on the web portal
2. Clear browser cookies for the Speak for Me domain
3. Sign in again using **Sign in with Slack**
4. Make sure you are signing in with the correct Slack workspace

### Admin Features Not Visible

**Cause:** Your account has the **member** role, not **admin**.

**Solution:**

1. Admin features are only visible to users with the admin role
2. The first person to install the Slack app is automatically the admin
3. Ask an existing admin to promote your account from the team management page
4. You can check your role on the [dashboard](/dashboard)

## Verifying Your Permissions

To check what permissions Speak for Me has in your workspace:

1. In Slack, go to **Settings & Administration** > **Manage Apps**
2. Find **Speak for Me** in the installed apps list
3. Review the permissions listed under the app details
4. If scopes are missing, the app may need to be reinstalled

<Callout type="info">
  If you reinstall the app, your watched conversations and style preferences are preserved. Only the Slack OAuth tokens are refreshed.
