  </Step>
  <Step>

  </Step>
  <Step>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Downgrading Your Plan

You can downgrade your plan at any time. The change takes effect at the end of your current billing period. Your existing features remain available until then.

<Callout type="info">
  Downgrading does not delete any data. Your style preferences, person context, and conversation history are preserved. You may lose access to some features depending on the new plan tier.
</Callout>

## Individual vs. Organization Billing

Speak for Me supports two billing models:

- **Individual billing**: You pay for your own subscription using your email address. This works independently of any organization.
- **Organization billing**: An admin pays for the entire team. Seats are billed per member.

If your organization has a team plan, you do not need an individual subscription. The organization plan covers your usage.

<Callout type="warn">
  If you have both an individual subscription and belong to an organization with a team plan, the organization plan takes precedence. Contact support if you need to cancel your individual subscription.
</Callout>

## Managing Payment Methods

Payment methods are managed through the Stripe Customer Portal:

1. Sign in to the [dashboard](/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **Billing** settings
3. Click **Manage Billing** to open the Stripe Customer Portal
4. From there you can update credit cards, view invoices, and download receipts

## Usage Limits

Each plan includes a monthly suggestion allowance. When you reach your limit:

- You will see a notification in Slack that your monthly limit has been reached
- Existing suggestions and history remain accessible
- The limit resets at the start of your next billing period
- You can upgrade your plan at any time to increase your allowance

## Coupons and Referrals

Speak for Me supports discount coupons and a referral program:

- **Coupons**: Enter a coupon code during checkout for a discount on your first billing period
- **Referrals**: Share your referral link to earn credits when friends sign up and subscribe
