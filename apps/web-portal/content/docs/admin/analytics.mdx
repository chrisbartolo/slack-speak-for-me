The team analytics dashboard provides insights into how your team uses Speak for Me. Track adoption rates, suggestion acceptance, and individual team member activity to understand the value the tool provides.

## Accessing analytics

Sign in to the [admin dashboard](/admin/analytics) and select **Analytics** from the admin sidebar. The analytics page is available to organization admins.

## Summary metrics

The dashboard displays four key metrics at a glance:

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| **Adoption rate** | Percentage of team members who have used Speak for Me at least once |
| **Acceptance rate** | Percentage of suggestions that were accepted (copied) by users |
| **Refinement rate** | Percentage of suggestions that were refined before use |
| **Estimated time saved** | Total time saved based on suggestion character counts and average typing speed |

## Adoption trends

A line chart shows how adoption has changed over the past 6 months. Each data point represents a month and shows the number of active users. This helps you identify whether usage is growing, stable, or declining.

## Action breakdown

A donut chart shows the distribution of suggestion outcomes: accepted, refined, and dismissed. This gives you a quick view of how useful the team finds AI suggestions overall.

## Per-user metrics

A detailed breakdown shows individual team member activity including:

- Number of suggestions received
- Acceptance, refinement, and dismissal counts
- Last active date

This helps identify team members who may need additional onboarding or support.
