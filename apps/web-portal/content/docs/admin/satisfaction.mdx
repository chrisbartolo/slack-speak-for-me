The satisfaction dashboard helps admins track team communication quality over time. It combines NPS surveys, health scores, and feedback trends into a comprehensive view of how well the AI is helping your team communicate.

## How it works

Speak for Me measures satisfaction through multiple signals:

1. **NPS Surveys** -- Periodic Slack DM surveys asking users to rate the product (0-10)
2. **Health Scores** -- Weekly composite scores combining multiple quality metrics
3. **Feedback Tracking** -- Thumbs up/down on AI suggestions over time
4. **Before/After Comparison** -- Baseline period vs current performance

<Callout type="info">
  Health scores are computed every Sunday at 2 AM UTC. Survey data appears after users respond to NPS surveys delivered on Mondays.
</Callout>

## Accessing the dashboard

Sign in to the [admin dashboard](/admin/satisfaction) and select **Satisfaction** from the **Analytics** group in the sidebar. This page is available to organization admins.

## Dashboard sections

### Health Score Gauge

The main health score (0-100) represents overall communication quality for your team:

| Score Range | Rating | Color |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| 80-100 | Excellent | Green |
| 60-79 | Good | Blue |
| 40-59 | Fair | Yellow |
| 0-39 | Needs Attention | Red |

The gauge also shows the change from the previous period (up or down arrow with percentage).

### NPS Distribution

A donut chart showing how users rated the product:

- **Promoters (9-10)** -- Users who would recommend Speak for Me (green)
- **Passives (7-8)** -- Neutral users (yellow)
- **Detractors (0-6)** -- Users who would not recommend (red)

The **NPS Score** is calculated as: `% Promoters - % Detractors` (ranges from -100 to +100).

### Survey Stats

Summary of NPS survey delivery and response:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Delivered** | Total surveys sent via Slack DM |
| **Completed** | Surveys where user submitted a rating |
| **Response Rate** | Percentage of completed surveys |
| **Avg Rating** | Mean rating from completed surveys |
| **Expired** | Surveys not responded to within 7 days |
| **Dismissed** | Surveys explicitly dismissed by users |

### Health Score Trend

A line chart showing health score over the past 12 weeks. This helps identify:

- Improving or declining communication quality
- Seasonal patterns
- Impact of training or process changes

### Before/After Comparison

Compares the **baseline period** (first 30 days of data) against **current performance**:

- **Baseline Score** -- Average health score during initial adoption
- **Current Score** -- Recent health score average
- **Improvement** -- Percentage change from baseline

<Callout type="info">
  The baseline period is automatically detected. Users with fewer than 5 weeks of data are still building their baseline.
</Callout>

### Thumbs Ratio Trend

A chart showing the approval rate over time based on suggestion feedback:

- **Thumbs Up** -- Suggestions that were accepted or sent
- **Thumbs Down** -- Suggestions that were dismissed
- **Ratio** -- Percentage of positive feedback (0-100%)

### Individual User Scores

A table showing health scores for each team member:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **User ID** | Slack user identifier |
| **Health Score** | Individual score (0-100) or "Insufficient" |
| **Acceptance Rate** | Percentage of suggestions accepted |
| **Engagement** | How often the user interacts with suggestions |
| **Suggestions** | Total suggestions received |
| **Status** | "Baseline" if still in initial period, otherwise "Active" |

Users with fewer than 5 suggestions show "Insufficient Data" instead of a score.

## Health score calculation

The health score is a weighted composite of five metrics:

| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Acceptance Rate** | 25% | How often users accept AI suggestions |
| **Response Time** | 20% | How quickly suggestions are delivered |
| **Sentiment** | 20% | Tone of conversations (from topic classification) |
| **Satisfaction** | 20% | NPS survey ratings |
| **Engagement** | 15% | How actively users interact with the product |

Each component is normalized to 0-100 before weighting. Missing data defaults to 50 (neutral).

## NPS surveys

### How surveys are delivered

1. Surveys are sent as Slack DMs every Monday at 9 AM UTC
2. Each user receives at most one survey every 30 days
3. Surveys include a 0-10 rating scale and optional feedback text
4. Users can submit or dismiss the survey

### Survey Block Kit format

The survey appears as an interactive Slack message with:

- Rating selection (0-10 radio buttons)
- Optional feedback text input
- Submit and Dismiss buttons

<Callout type="warn">
  Surveys expire after 7 days if not responded to. Expired surveys are tracked but do not count toward NPS calculations.
</Callout>

## Improving health scores

To improve your team's health scores:

1. **Encourage feedback** -- Remind users to use thumbs up/down on suggestions
2. **Complete surveys** -- Higher response rates give more accurate NPS data
3. **Refine style settings** -- Better style preferences lead to more relevant suggestions
4. **Add context** -- Person and conversation notes improve suggestion quality
5. **Review learning loop** -- Approve high-quality KB candidates to improve future suggestions
