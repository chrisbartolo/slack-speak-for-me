import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

The compliance audit trail provides a detailed record of all AI-assisted activity and administrative changes within your organization. This helps meet compliance requirements and gives admins visibility into how Speak for Me is being used.

## Accessing the audit trail

Sign in to the [admin dashboard](/admin/audit-trail) and select **Audit Trail** from the admin sidebar.

## What is logged

The audit trail captures two categories of events:

### AI activity

| Event | Details captured |
|---|---|
| **Suggestion generated** | Timestamp, user, channel, action taken |
| **Suggestion accepted** | When a user copies a suggestion |
| **Suggestion refined** | When a user refines a suggestion before use |
| **Suggestion dismissed** | When a user dismisses a suggestion |
| **Guardrail violation** | When a suggestion is blocked or flagged by guardrails |

### Admin actions

| Event | Details captured |
|---|---|
| **Settings changed** | Which setting was modified and by whom |
| **Template approved/rejected** | Template name, reviewer, decision |
| **User role changed** | Who changed, old role, new role |
| **Guardrail config updated** | What was added or removed |

<Callout type="info">
  Suggestion text visibility in the audit trail depends on your plan tier. Higher-tier plans include the full suggestion text; lower tiers show metadata only.
</Callout>

## Filtering and sorting

The audit trail table supports:

- **Search** by user name or event type
- **Filter** by date range, action type, or user
- **Sort** by any column (timestamp, user, action, channel)
- **Pagination** for navigating large datasets

## Exporting audit data

Two export formats are available:

| Format | Availability | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **CSV** | Starter plans and above | Spreadsheet analysis, custom reporting |
| **PDF** | Team plans and above | Compliance documentation, formal reports |

Click the **Export CSV** or **Export PDF** button at the top of the audit trail page.

## Data retention

Audit trail data is retained based on your plan tier:

| Plan | Retention period |
|---|---|
| Free | 7 days |
| Starter | 30 days |
| Pro | 90 days |
| Team | 90 days |
| Business | 90 days |

Data older than your retention period is automatically deleted by a daily cleanup job.

<Callout type="warn">
  Exported data is not subject to retention limits. If you need long-term audit records, export regularly.
</Callout>
