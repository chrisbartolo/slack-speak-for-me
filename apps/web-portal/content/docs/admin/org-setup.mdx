Organizations group one or more Slack workspaces together under a single billing account. This makes it easy to manage subscriptions and team access across your company.

## How Organizations Work

When you install Speak for Me to a Slack workspace, an organization is automatically created. Each organization has:

- A **unique name and slug** used in the web portal URL
- One or more **Slack workspaces** connected to it
- A single **billing subscription** that covers all workspaces
- **Admin and member roles** for access control

  Organizations are created automatically during the first Slack app installation. You do not need to create one manually.
</Callout>

## Setting Up Your Organization

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Install the Slack App

    Visit the [installation page](/install) and click **Add to Slack**. Authorize the app with your Slack workspace. This creates your organization automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Sign In to the Web Portal

    Go to the [dashboard](/dashboard) and sign in with your Slack account. As the installer, you are assigned the **admin** role.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Review Organization Settings

    From the dashboard, review your organization name and settings. The organization name defaults to your Slack workspace name but can be updated.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Invite Your Team

    Share the Speak for Me install link with your team. When teammates authorize the app, they are automatically added to your organization as **members**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding Workspaces

If your company uses multiple Slack workspaces (for example, separate workspaces for different departments), you can connect them to the same organization:

1. Sign in to the web portal with an admin account
2. Navigate to the admin settings
3. Use the **Add Workspace** option to install the Slack app in additional workspaces
4. Each new workspace shares the same billing subscription

<Callout type="warn">
  Only organization admins can add new workspaces. Members can only use Speak for Me within workspaces that are already connected.
</Callout>

## Organization Preferences

Admins can configure the following organization-wide settings:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Organization Name** | Display name shown in the web portal |
| **Billing Email** | Email address for invoices and billing notifications |
| **Default Plan** | The subscription plan applied to new team members |
