Team management lets admins view who is using Speak for Me, assign roles, and understand how seats affect billing.

## Viewing Team Members

From the admin dashboard, you can see all team members in your organization:

1. Sign in to the [web portal](/dashboard)
2. Click **Admin Dashboard** in the sidebar, then go to **Organizations**
3. Select your organization to view the team members list showing name, email, plan, usage, and workspace

The team member list is synchronized with your Slack workspace. When someone joins your Slack workspace and authorizes Speak for Me, they automatically appear in the team list.

<Callout type="info">
  Team members are synced from Slack. You do not need to manually invite users. Anyone who authorizes the Speak for Me Slack app in a connected workspace is added automatically.
</Callout>

## User Roles

Speak for Me has three user roles:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|------------|
| **Super Admin** | All admin permissions plus cross-organization access, plan management, coupon management, and usage resets. Configured via the `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS` environment variable. |
| **Admin** | Organization settings, billing, team analytics, response times, communication insights, compliance tools, and all member features. Scoped to their own organization. |
| **Member** | Access to personal dashboard, style preferences, watched conversations, and suggestion history |

The person who first installs the Slack app becomes the admin. Additional admins can be promoted from the admin dashboard. Super admin status is granted by adding your email to the `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAILS` environment variable.

## Seat-Based Billing

For team plans, billing is calculated per seat:

- Each team member who has authorized the Speak for Me app counts as one **seat**
- Your monthly bill is calculated as: **plan price x number of seats**
- When a new member joins, the seat count increases and billing is prorated
- When a member is removed or deactivated, the seat count decreases at the next billing cycle

<Callout type="warn">
  Seats are counted based on active Slack users who have authorized the app. Deactivated Slack users are automatically removed from the seat count.
</Callout>

## Managing Team Access

### Promoting a Member to Admin

1. Go to the **Admin** section of the dashboard
2. Find the team member in the list
3. Click on their profile
4. Change their role from **Member** to **Admin**

### Removing a Team Member

If someone leaves your organization:

1. Remove them from your Slack workspace (this is done in Slack, not in Speak for Me)
2. Their Speak for Me access is automatically revoked
3. Their seat is freed at the next billing cycle
4. Their personal data (style preferences, suggestion history) is retained for 30 days before automatic deletion
