Sometimes a suggestion is close but not quite right. The refinement feature lets you adjust suggestions with natural language feedback until they match exactly what you want to say.

## How refinement works

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Click the Refine button

    When you receive an [AI suggestion](/docs/features/suggestions), click the **Refine** button on the ephemeral message. This opens a refinement dialog.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Provide your feedback

    In the dialog, type what you would like to change. Use natural language -- there are no special commands. For example:

    - "Make it shorter and more direct"
    - "Add a thank you at the beginning"
    - "Use a more formal tone"
    - "Remove the part about the deadline"
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Review the updated suggestion

    The AI generates a revised suggestion based on your feedback. You can see both the original and the updated version.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Refine again or copy

    If the updated suggestion still needs adjustment, provide more feedback. You can refine multiple times. When you are happy with the result, click **Copy** to use it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Tips for effective refinement

| Approach | Example |
|---|---|
| Be specific | "Replace the first sentence with a greeting" |
| Describe the tone | "Make it sound more empathetic" |
| Add or remove content | "Include a mention of next steps" |
| Adjust length | "Cut this down to two sentences" |

<Callout type="info">
  Each refinement round uses a small amount of your monthly suggestion allowance. Multi-round refinements are fine -- just be aware of your [usage limits](/docs/features/reports).
</Callout>

## How refinement improves future suggestions

The AI tracks your refinement patterns over time. If you frequently ask for shorter responses or more formal language, those preferences gradually influence how future suggestions are generated -- even before you refine them.
