Style settings let you tell the AI how you want your suggestions to sound. By configuring your preferred tone, formality level, and custom phrases, every suggestion will feel more like something you would actually write.

## Accessing style settings

Sign in to the [web portal dashboard](/dashboard) and click **Style** in the sidebar navigation. The style settings page shows all available configuration options.

## Available settings

### Tone

Choose the overall emotional quality of your suggestions:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| Professional | Straightforward and business-appropriate |
| Friendly | Warm and approachable |
| Direct | Brief and to the point |
| Empathetic | Considerate and understanding |

You can select one tone or combine multiple tones to match your natural communication style.

### Formality level

Set how formal or casual your suggestions should be. This affects word choice, sentence structure, and greetings.

### Custom phrases

Define phrases that the AI should use or avoid in your suggestions:

- **Phrases to use** -- Words or expressions you regularly include (for example, "Happy to help" or "Let me look into that")
- **Phrases to avoid** -- Words or expressions that do not fit your style (for example, overly casual slang or corporate jargon)

<Callout type="warn">
  Style changes take effect on your next suggestion. Existing suggestions will not be regenerated with the new settings.
</Callout>

## How style settings affect suggestions

When the AI generates a suggestion, it incorporates your style settings alongside the conversation context and person context. Your style acts as a guide for how the AI writes -- not just what it says, but how it says it.

If your suggestions consistently do not match your expectations, updating your style settings is the most effective way to improve them.
