description: Automated detection and alerts for tense or frustrated client conversations

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

Escalation alerts automatically monitor conversations with known client contacts for signs of tension, frustration, or dissatisfaction. When the system detects a potentially escalating situation, it notifies the relevant team members so they can intervene early.

## How detection works

The AI analyzes messages from client contacts in watched conversations and evaluates the emotional tone. Detection runs in the background and does not affect suggestion generation speed.

The system looks for signals such as:

- Expressions of frustration or dissatisfaction
- Repeated requests or follow-ups indicating unresolved issues
- Language suggesting urgency or threat of churn
- Negative sentiment about your product or service

## Severity levels

Each detected escalation is assigned a severity level:

| Level | Description | Typical triggers |
|---|---|---|
| **Medium** | Mild frustration or concern detected | Slightly negative tone, minor complaints |
| **High** | Clear dissatisfaction or repeated issues | Strong negative language, unresolved follow-ups |
| **Critical** | Urgent situation requiring immediate attention | Threats to cancel, legal language, extreme frustration |

## How you are notified

When an escalation is detected, the system sends a direct message to the team member responsible for that client. The alert includes:

- The severity level
- A summary of what triggered the detection
- A link to the conversation in Slack
- The client profile for quick reference

<Callout type="info">
  Escalation alerts are sent as Slack DMs to ensure they are seen promptly. They do not appear in the client's conversation.
</Callout>

## De-escalation mode

When a conversation is flagged as escalating, the AI automatically switches to **de-escalation mode** for its suggestions. In this mode, suggestions are:

- More empathetic and understanding in tone
- Focused on acknowledging the client's concerns
- Structured to move toward resolution
- Careful to avoid defensive or dismissive language

De-escalation mode is applied automatically and does not require any action from you. It remains active for the duration of the escalated conversation.

## Managing alerts

Admins can view and manage escalation alerts from the [Client Management](/docs/admin/client-management) admin page. Each alert can be:

- **Acknowledged** -- Marks that someone is aware and handling the situation
- **Resolved** -- Marks the escalation as addressed

<Callout type="warn">
  Escalation detection requires client contacts to be configured. The system only monitors conversations with known client contacts, not all watched conversations.
</Callout>
