Message shortcuts let you get an AI-generated response for any Slack message -- even in conversations you are not watching. This is useful when you encounter a message that needs a thoughtful reply and want a quick starting point.

## How to use shortcuts

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Find the message

    Navigate to any message in Slack that you want help responding to.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Open the shortcut menu

    Hover over the message and click the **three-dot menu** (or right-click on the message). Select **Help me respond** from the shortcuts menu.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Receive your suggestion

    Speak for Me generates a response suggestion based on the message and its surrounding context. The suggestion appears as an ephemeral message, just like automatic suggestions.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Copy, refine, or dismiss

    Use the same action buttons as with automatic suggestions: **Copy** the text, **Refine** it with feedback, or **Dismiss** it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Shortcuts vs. watching

| Aspect | Watching | Shortcuts |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | Automatic -- suggestions appear when messages arrive | Manual -- you choose which message to respond to |
| Setup | Requires `/watch` in the channel | No setup needed |
| Best for | Channels with frequent incoming messages | One-off messages that need a thoughtful reply |
| Scope | All relevant messages in the watched conversation | A single specific message |

<Callout type="info">
  You can use shortcuts in any conversation, including channels you are not watching. Shortcuts work independently of the `/watch` feature.
</Callout>

## When to use shortcuts

- You receive an unexpected message that needs a diplomatic response
- A colleague asks a question in a channel you do not regularly monitor
- You want help responding to a message in a group DM
- You need to craft a careful reply to sensitive feedback
