When a relevant message appears in a watched conversation, Speak for Me generates a response suggestion and delivers it privately to you. This page explains how the AI creates those suggestions and what you can do with them.

## How suggestions are triggered

Speak for Me monitors your [watched conversations](/docs/features/watching) and generates a suggestion when it detects a message that is relevant to you -- such as an @mention, a reply to your message, or a new message in an active thread.

The suggestion is processed in the background and typically appears within a few seconds.

## What the AI considers

Each suggestion is crafted using multiple sources of context:

| Context source | Description |
|---|---|
| Recent messages | The last several messages in the conversation for full context |
| Your style settings | Tone, formality, and custom phrases from your [style configuration](/docs/features/style-settings) |
| Person context | Notes you have saved about specific people or relationships |
| Conversation history | Previous interactions in the same thread |

This combination helps the AI produce suggestions that are relevant to the conversation and sound like you.

## Ephemeral message delivery

<Callout type="info">
  Suggestions are delivered as ephemeral messages -- private messages that only you can see. No one else in the channel will ever see your AI suggestions, and they disappear when you reload Slack.
</Callout>

Each suggestion message includes three action buttons:

- **Copy** -- Copies the suggestion text to your clipboard so you can paste it into the message input and send it as your own reply
- **Refine** -- Opens a refinement dialog where you can adjust the suggestion with feedback like "make it shorter" or "more casual"
- **Dismiss** -- Removes the suggestion if you do not need it

## Tips for better suggestions

- **Keep your style settings up to date** -- The AI relies on your configured tone and preferences
- **Add person context** -- Notes about specific colleagues help the AI tailor its suggestions
- **Use refinement** -- The more you refine, the better the AI learns your preferences over time
