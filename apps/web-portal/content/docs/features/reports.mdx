Speak for Me can aggregate your team's weekly status updates from Slack Workflow Builder submissions and generate formatted reports. This feature is useful for managers and team leads who want a consolidated view of what their team accomplished.

## How it works

Team members submit their weekly updates through a Slack Workflow Builder form. Speak for Me detects these submissions, logs them to a Google Sheet, and can generate a summary report on demand or on a schedule.

## Setting up weekly reports

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Connect Google Sheets

    From the [web portal dashboard](/dashboard/reports), click **Connect Google Sheets**. Sign in with your Google account and authorize Speak for Me to create and edit spreadsheets on your behalf.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Configure a Slack Workflow

    Create a Workflow Builder form in Slack for your team's status updates. Speak for Me will automatically detect submissions from the workflow and log them to your connected spreadsheet.

    <Callout type="info">
      Speak for Me auto-learns which bot posts workflow submissions. The first time a workflow submission is detected, it registers the bot for future recognition.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Generate a report

    Use the `/generate-report` slash command in Slack to create a report on demand. The AI reads all submissions from the current week, analyzes them, and produces a formatted summary.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### (Optional) Schedule automatic reports

    From the dashboard, set up a recurring schedule for automatic report generation. Choose your preferred day of the week, time, and timezone. Reports will be generated and delivered automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>
