Speak for Me automatically detects actionable items from messages in your watched conversations and surfaces them as tasks. Whether someone asks you to review a document, you commit to sending a follow-up, or a deadline is mentioned, Speak for Me captures it so nothing falls through the cracks.

## How it works

When a message arrives in a watched conversation, the AI analyzes it for actionable content. If it detects a request, commitment, or deadline directed at you, it creates a task with a title, description, and optional due date. Tasks are stored per user and per workspace, and you can manage them from Slack or the web dashboard.

## Task types

Speak for Me categorizes detected tasks into three types:

- **Action Request** -- Someone asks you to do something. Examples: "Can you review this PR?", "Please handle the deployment", "When can you send the report?"
- **Commitment** -- You commit to doing something. Examples: "I'll take care of it", "Sure, I'll send it over", "Let me follow up on that"
- **Deadline** -- A time constraint is mentioned for an action. Examples: "Need this by Friday", "Before EOD tomorrow", "Due March 15"

<Callout type="info">
  Only actionable items with a confidence score of 50 or higher are surfaced as tasks. The AI filters out general discussions, status updates, and informational messages.
</Callout>

## Using the `/speakforme-tasks` command

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### View your pending tasks

    Type `/speakforme-tasks` in any Slack channel or DM. Your tasks are displayed as a private ephemeral message visible only to you.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Review tasks by urgency

    Tasks are grouped into sections so you can focus on what matters most:
    - **Overdue** -- Tasks past their due date, shown with a warning indicator
    - **Due Today** -- Tasks due within the current day
    - **Other Tasks** -- Everything else, sorted by due date and confidence score
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Take action on a task

    Each task has an overflow menu with the following options:
    - **Complete** -- Mark the task as done
    - **Snooze 1 day** -- Push the task back by one day so it reappears later
    - **Dismiss** -- Remove the task from your list if it is no longer relevant
    - **View in Slack** -- Jump to the original message that triggered the task
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Get help

    Run `/speakforme-tasks help` for a quick usage summary directly in Slack.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing tasks from the dashboard

The [web portal dashboard](/dashboard/tasks) provides a full view of all your tasks, including completed and dismissed items. From the dashboard you can:

- Filter tasks by status (pending, completed, dismissed, snoozed)
- View task details including the original message text and AI reasoning
- See statistics such as total pending, overdue, and due today counts
- Review historical tasks for accountability and tracking

## How due dates are determined

When the AI detects a deadline, it assigns a confidence level to the due date:

- **Explicit** -- A specific date or time is stated in the message (e.g., "by March 15")
- **Implicit** -- A relative time reference is used (e.g., "tomorrow", "next week")
- **Inferred** -- The AI infers urgency from context (e.g., "ASAP", "as soon as possible")

Tasks without a clear time constraint are created without a due date and appear at the end of your task list.
