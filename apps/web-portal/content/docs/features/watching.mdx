Watching is the core mechanism that tells Speak for Me which conversations to monitor. When you watch a conversation, the AI will generate response suggestions whenever relevant messages appear.

## Starting and stopping

Use these slash commands in any Slack channel or DM:

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/watch` | Start monitoring the current conversation |
| `/unwatch` | Stop monitoring the current conversation |

When you run `/watch`, Speak for Me confirms with a private message that monitoring is active. Only you will know that the conversation is being watched.

## What can be watched

You can watch any conversation you have access to in Slack:

- **Public channels** -- Team channels, project channels, or any channel you belong to
- **Private channels** -- Channels you have been invited to
- **Direct messages** -- One-on-one conversations
- **Group DMs** -- Conversations with multiple people

<Callout type="info">
  In direct messages, Speak for Me only triggers suggestions from messages sent by the other person. Your own messages are never treated as triggers.
</Callout>

## What triggers a suggestion

Not every message in a watched conversation generates a suggestion. Speak for Me looks for messages that are relevant to you:

| Trigger type | Description |
|---|---|
| @mention | Someone mentions you by name |
| Reply | Someone replies to a message you sent |
| Active thread | A new message in a thread you participated in |

## Managing watched conversations

You can view and manage all your watched conversations from the [web portal dashboard](/dashboard/conversations). The dashboard shows each watched conversation with its channel name, type, and when it was added.

To stop watching a conversation, you can either type `/unwatch` in Slack or remove it from the dashboard.
