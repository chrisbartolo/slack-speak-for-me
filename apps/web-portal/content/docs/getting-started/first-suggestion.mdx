Once Speak for Me is installed, you can start receiving suggestions in any channel or DM. Here is how to get your first one.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open a Slack channel

    Navigate to a channel where you regularly have conversations. This could be a team channel, a project channel, or a direct message.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Type `/watch` to start monitoring

    In the message input, type `/watch` and press Enter. Speak for Me will confirm that it is now monitoring this conversation for you.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Wait for a message

    When someone sends a message in the watched conversation -- such as a question directed at you, a reply to your message, or an `@mention` -- Speak for Me will generate a suggestion.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### See the ephemeral suggestion

    A private message appears that only you can see. It contains an AI-generated response suggestion based on the conversation context and your communication style.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Use Copy or Refine

    - Click **Copy** to copy the suggestion to your clipboard, then paste it into the message input
    - Click **Refine** to open a dialog where you can adjust the suggestion with feedback
    - Click **Dismiss** if the suggestion is not needed
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  Ephemeral messages are private -- only you can see them. Other people in the channel will never see your AI suggestions.
</Callout>

## What triggers a suggestion?

| Trigger | Description |
|---|---|
| @mention | Someone mentions you directly in a watched conversation |
| Reply | Someone replies to a message you sent |
| Active thread | A new message appears in a thread you are part of |
| Message shortcut | You right-click a message and select "Help me respond" |
