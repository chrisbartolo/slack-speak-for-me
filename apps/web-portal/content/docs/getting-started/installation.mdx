Adding Speak for Me to your Slack workspace takes less than a minute. Follow the steps below to get started.

<Callout type="info">
  You may need Slack workspace admin permissions to install new apps. If you don't have admin access, ask your workspace administrator to approve the installation.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Visit the Speak for Me website

    Go to the [Speak for Me homepage](/) and click the **Add to Slack** button. This opens Slack's authorization page.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Authorize app permissions

    Slack will ask you to approve the following permissions:

    | Permission | Purpose |
    |---|---|
    | View messages in channels | Read conversation context for generating suggestions |
    | Send messages as bot | Deliver private suggestion messages to you |
    | Use slash commands | Enable `/watch`, `/unwatch`, and other commands |
    | View user profiles | Personalize suggestions based on participants |

    Click **Allow** to grant these permissions.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Confirm installation

    After authorization, you will be redirected to the onboarding page. The Speak for Me bot now appears in your workspace's app list.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What happens after installation

Once installed, the Speak for Me bot joins your workspace but does not monitor any conversations by default. You are in full control of which channels and DMs are watched.

Your next step is to [start watching a conversation](/docs/getting-started/first-suggestion) so you can receive your first AI suggestion.

## Required Slack permissions

Speak for Me uses Slack's OAuth 2.0 flow and only requests the minimum permissions needed to function. No message content is stored permanently -- it is used only during suggestion generation and then discarded.
