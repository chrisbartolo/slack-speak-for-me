# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-26)

**Core value:** When a challenging message arrives, the user gets an intelligent suggested response that sounds like them, considers full context, and helps them respond professionally without emotional reactivity.
**Current focus:** Production Deployment - LIVE

## Current Position

Phase: 17 of 20 (Communication Pattern Insights) - IN PROGRESS
Plan: 01 of 04 - COMPLETE (Database Schema)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-04 - Completed 17-01-PLAN.md

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 5 Plan 01: googleapis library for Google Sheets API - Official client with OAuth2 and auto-refresh support
- Phase 5 Plan 01: OAuth state CSRF protection - workspaceId/userId encoded as base64 JSON in state parameter
- Phase 5 Plan 01: Offline access with consent prompt - Ensures refresh token is returned for auto-refresh
- Phase 5 Plan 01: Auto-refresh token handler - OAuth2Client 'tokens' event updates encrypted tokens in database
- Phase 5 Plan 02: OAuth start route with session data - /oauth/google/start receives workspaceId/userId from web-portal
- Phase 5 Plan 02: OAuth callback redirects with query params - Success and error states communicated via URL parameters
- Phase 5 Plan 02: WEB_PORTAL_URL defaults to localhost:3001 - Environment variable for OAuth callback redirects
- Phase 5 Plan 03: Heuristic parser for workflow fields - Handles varied Workflow Builder formats with flexible field matching
- Phase 5 Plan 03: Auto-learning workflowBotId - First submission teaches system which bot posts workflows
- Phase 5 Plan 03: Rate limiting at 30 writes/min - Safety margin under Google Sheets 60/min API limit
- Phase 5 Plan 04: Claude Sonnet 4 for report generation - Same model as suggestions, 2048 max tokens for longer reports
- Phase 5 Plan 04: Monday-based weeks for reports - date-fns startOfWeek with weekStartsOn: 1 aligns with business convention
- Phase 5 Plan 05: Store spreadsheetId in googleIntegrations - Single source of truth for user's configured spreadsheet
- Phase 5 Plan 05: Response URL for slash command feedback - Async job completion posts success/error to command response_url
- Phase 5 Plan 06: BullMQ Job Schedulers for automated reports - Cron-based scheduling with timezone support, survives restarts via startup sync
- Phase 5 Plan 07: report_copy opens modal with copyable text in code block
- Phase 5 Plan 07: report_refine opens refinement modal with feedback input
- Phase 5 Plan 08: Prerequisite gating - Disable workflow and report forms until spreadsheet configured
- Phase 5 Plan 09: Scheduler sync on startup - Schedulers persist across restarts via syncAllReportSchedulers()
- Phase 16 Plan 01: Denormalized organizationId in metrics - Not a foreign key, filled at record time for fast org-wide queries
- Phase 16 Plan 01: Nullable pipeline timestamps - All stage timestamps nullable, filled incrementally as suggestion progresses
- Phase 16 Plan 01: Pre-computed duration columns - Stored in milliseconds to avoid recalculating in every query
- Phase 16 Plan 01: Unique constraint on suggestionId - Enables onConflictDoUpdate upsert pattern
- Phase 16 Plan 02: Fire-and-forget pattern - All recording functions wrapped in try/catch with logger.warn, never throw
- Phase 16 Plan 02: Upsert pattern - onConflictDoUpdate on suggestionId allows stages to be recorded independently
- Phase 16 Plan 02: organizationId caching - 5-minute TTL cache reduces database lookups for workspace→org resolution
- Phase 16 Plan 02: Placeholder UUID pattern - Insert operations use placeholder UUID since suggestionId is the real unique key
- Phase 16 Plan 03: suggestionId in AIResponseJobData - Flow through job data ensures worker access without regeneration
- Phase 16 Plan 03: Fire-and-forget with .catch(() => {}) - All 8 integration points use non-blocking pattern for zero latency impact
- Phase 16 Plan 03: Multiple delivery path recording - YOLO, response_url, and ephemeral paths each record delivery independently
- Phase 16 Plan 04: PERCENTILE_CONT for accurate percentiles - PostgreSQL function for exact p50/p95 instead of approximations
- Phase 16 Plan 04: Default SLA threshold of 10 seconds - Configurable threshold for suggestion delivery compliance tracking
- Phase 16 Plan 04: Time saved assumes 5 minutes manual response time - Conservative estimate vs instant AI draft
- Phase 16 Plan 04: Top 20 channels and users by volume - Focused analysis without overwhelming UI
- Phase 16 Plan 04: CSV export limited to 10,000 rows - Performance safeguard while covering 90+ days typical data
- Phase 16 Plan 04: Stage breakdown shows queue/AI/delivery separately - Three-stage isolation for targeted performance optimization
- Phase 17 Plan 01: suggestionId as unique key (not foreign key) - Follows suggestionMetrics pattern for flexible suggestion tracking
- Phase 17 Plan 01: Confidence stored as integer 0-100 - Matches actionableItems pattern, multiply float by 100 before insert
- Phase 17 Plan 01: JSONB for sentiment and aggregates - Flexible schema for SentimentAnalysis objects and trend distributions
- Phase 17 Plan 01: Unique constraint on trend records - (organizationId, trendDate, trendPeriod) ensures one daily record per org

### Pending Todos

- ✅ Deploy to DigitalOcean App Platform - DONE
- Configure Slack App settings with production redirect URLs:
  - OAuth Redirect: `https://slack-speak-for-me-z3w85.ondigitalocean.app/slack/oauth_redirect`
  - Web Portal Login: `https://slack-speak-for-me-z3w85.ondigitalocean.app/callback`
- Update Google Cloud Console redirect URI to production URL
- Generate logo and marketing imagery
- Test production deployment end-to-end with actual Slack workspace

### Blockers/Concerns

**Research-identified risks to address:**
- Phase 1: HTTP webhooks required for production (Socket Mode hits 10 workspace limit) ✅ Using HTTP mode
- Phase 3: pgvector extension required in production PostgreSQL - Enable manually after DB creation

**Production deployment notes:**
- All CRITICAL and HIGH security issues fixed ✅
- Dockerfiles created for both services ✅
- app.yaml ready and deployed ✅
- Landing page with Add to Slack button created ✅
- Post-install onboarding wizard created ✅
- Page scrolling fixed (removed overflow-hidden from layout) ✅

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-04
Stopped at: Completed 17-01-PLAN.md (Database Schema for Pattern Insights)
Resume file: None

**Deployment Issues Resolved (2026-01-31):**
1. TypeScript .d.ts files not generating in Docker → Added explicit `composite: false`, `declaration: true` to package tsconfigs
2. npm workspaces not found in Docker → Changed to direct `npx drizzle-kit push` command
3. Self-signed certificate errors → Different fixes for pg vs postgres.js libraries:
   - Migration (pg): `?sslmode=require&uselibpqcompat=true`
   - Runtime (postgres.js): `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }`
4. Validation package loading TypeScript at runtime → Fixed package.json to point to dist/
5. Routing conflicts → Reorganized routes: slack-backend handles /slack, /oauth, /health; web-portal handles everything else
6. Page not scrolling → Removed `overflow-hidden` from layout.tsx body

**Next action:** Configure Slack App redirect URLs in Slack App settings, then test full OAuth flow
