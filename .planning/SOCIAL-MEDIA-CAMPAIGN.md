#### Day 1 (Monday) — "The Overthinking Problem"

**Content Pillar:** Pain Point
**Post Time:** 10:00 AM EST | **Story Time:** 12:30 PM EST

**Boost as ad:** Yes — awareness campaign

Below, a minimal clock illustration with blue-to-indigo gradient (#3B82F6 to #6366F1) showing time ticking. Small brushstroke accent underneath the text. Bottom has subtle branding area. Professional, data-driven feel. No people. Modern sans-serif typography.

```

**Caption:**
```
You know that feeling.

Someone sends a message in Slack that makes your stomach drop. A passive-aggressive comment. A client complaint. A request that's actually unreasonable.

And you sit there. Staring at the cursor. Rewriting the same sentence four different ways.

17 minutes later, you finally hit send — and immediately wonder if you should've said it differently.

What if you didn't have to agonize over it?

Speak for Me uses AI to suggest the perfect response in seconds. Private. Context-aware. Sounds like you, not a robot.

**Boost as ad:** Yes — awareness campaign

Carousel-style single image on warm cream background (#FFFDF7). List format with bold headlines and brief descriptions. Title at top: "Messages we all dread responding to:" followed by five items, each with a small colored emoji-style icon: "1. The passive-aggressive 'as I mentioned previously'" "2.

Each item has subtle blue-indigo brushstroke accent. Bottom text: "Speak for Me handles all of them." Modern, list-style infographic.
```

**Story Image Prompt (1080x1920):**
```
Poll-style story on warm cream background. Large text: "Which Slack message makes you sweat the most?" Four options listed with colorful icons: "The passive-aggressive one" "The angry client" "The unreasonable request" "The vague 'can we sync?'". Interactive feel. Blue-indigo accent colors. Bottom: small Speak for Me logo. Fun, engaging, relatable.
```

**Caption:**
```
Which one makes you sweat? Be honest.

1. The passive-aggressive "as I mentioned previously..."
2. The client who's objectively wrong but pays the bills
3. "Quick question" that's actually a 3-hour task
4. "Can we hop on a call?" with zero context
5. The vague "can we sync?" with absolutely no context

We built Speak for Me because every professional has THAT message sitting in their Slack right now.

The one they've been avoiding. The one they keep opening and closing.

AI-powered response suggestions. Private. Instant. Actually sounds like you.

#### Day 5 (Friday) — "3 Rules for Difficult Messages"

**Content Pillar:** Tips & Educational
**Post Time:** 10:00 AM EST | **Story Time:** 2:00 PM EST
**Hashtag Set:** E + #SpeakForMe
**Boost as ad:** No — organic only

**Feed Post Image Prompt (1080x1440):**
```
Educational tips graphic on warm cream background (#FFFDF7). Header: "3 rules for responding to difficult messages" with blue-indigo brushstroke underline. Three numbered sections with icons: "1. Acknowledge first — show you heard them" with an ear icon. "2. Separate emotion from facts — respond to what was said, not how" with a filter icon. "3. Offer a path forward — don't just defend" with a road/arrow icon. Each section has subtle blue-indigo gradient accent. Footer: "Or let AI handle the hard part. @speakformeapp" Clean, educational, shareable design.
```

**Story Image Prompt (1080x1920):**
```
Vertical tips story on dark navy background (#0F172A). Swipe-through feel. Large "TIP #1" in blue-indigo gradient at top. Center text in white: "Always acknowledge before responding. Even if they're wrong, they need to feel heard first." Small example: "'I understand your frustration about the timeline...'" Bottom: "Swipe for more" arrow. Minimal, educational, premium.
```

**Caption:**
```
Before you type that reply, remember:

Rule 1: Acknowledge first.
Even if they're completely wrong, lead with "I understand your concern about..." People can't hear solutions until they feel heard.

Rule 2: Facts, not feelings.
The message made you angry. Your response shouldn't. Strip the emotion, respond to the substance.

Rule 3: Path forward > defense.
"Here's what I suggest we do next" beats "That's not what happened" every time.

These three rules work. But they're hard to execute in the moment when your blood pressure is rising.

That's exactly why we built Speak for Me — AI that applies these principles instantly, in your voice, right inside Slack.

Save this post for next time that message drops.

#### Day 6 (Saturday) — "Why I Built This"

**Content Pillar:** Behind the Scenes / Build in Public

**Feed Post Image Prompt (1080x1440):**
```
Founder story graphic on warm cream background (#FFFDF7). Top: small Speak for Me brushstroke "S" logo. Center: large quotation marks in blue-indigo gradient framing the text: "I watched a colleague spend 45 minutes writing a 3-sentence reply to a difficult client. That's when I knew there had to be a better way." Underneath: a horizontal brushstroke divider. Bottom: "The story behind Speak for Me" with a subtle code/terminal aesthetic element. Authentic, personal, clean.
```

**Story Image Prompt (1080x1920):**
```
Vertical behind-the-scenes story on warm cream background. Top: "The story behind Speak for Me" with brushstroke underline. Middle: informal workspace photo-style illustration — laptop, coffee, Slack open, code editor visible. Abstract, illustrated, not a real photo. Blue-indigo tones. Bottom: "Built by someone who's been there." Personal, authentic feel.
```

**Caption:**
```
Here's why Speak for Me exists.

I used to work with a CMO who was brilliant but terrifying. Every message from them was a minefield. Respond too directly? Conflict. Too soft? Walked over. Too slow? "Are you even working?"

My colleague once spent 45 minutes crafting a three-sentence reply. I've seen senior managers screenshot messages and group-text friends asking "how do I respond to this?"

We all do it. We just don't talk about it.

So I built an AI that sits inside Slack and privately suggests how to respond. It reads the full context. It matches your writing style. Nobody knows you're using it.

Because the hardest part of work isn't the work — it's the communication around it.

Because when someone sends a difficult message, the clock is ticking. Every minute you don't respond, the anxiety builds.

#### Day 12 (Friday) — "5 Messages AI Handles Better"

**Content Pillar:** Educational
**Post Time:** 10:00 AM EST | **Story Time:** 2:00 PM EST
**Hashtag Set:** A + #SpeakForMe
**Boost as ad:** No

**Feed Post Image Prompt (1080x1440):**
```
Listicle graphic on warm cream background (#FFFDF7). Header: "5 Slack messages AI handles better than you" with blue-indigo brushstroke underline. Five items in a clean list, each with an icon: "1. Scope creep pushback" (shield icon), "2. Performance feedback" (chart icon), "3. Deadline renegotiation" (calendar icon), "4. Client escalation" (warning icon), "5. Cross-team handoff" (handshake icon). Each icon in blue-indigo gradient. Footer: "Speak for Me — free for Slack" with logo. Shareable, save-worthy design.
```

**Story Image Prompt (1080x1920):**
```
Vertical listicle story on warm cream background. "Save this" bookmark icon at top. One featured item per story slide style: "#1: Scope creep pushback" with an example: "Message: 'Can we also add X, Y, and Z?' AI Response: 'Happy to explore that — let me scope it and share what it would mean for the timeline.'" Blue-indigo accents. Clean.
```

**Caption:**
```
5 Slack messages AI genuinely handles better than most humans:

1. Scope creep pushback — says no without burning the relationship
2. Performance feedback — direct but constructive, never personal
3. Deadline renegotiation — frames it around solutions, not excuses
4. Client escalation — empathetic but firm, keeps things professional
5. Cross-team handoff — clear ownership, no ambiguity

Why does AI handle these well? Because it doesn't have ego, anxiety, or a bad morning. It just reads the context and applies communication best practices.

That's what Speak for Me does inside your Slack. Context-aware. Style-matched. Private.

Save this for next time you're stuck.

**Caption:**
```
The #1 question we get: "Can my teammates see that I'm using this?"

No. That's the whole point.

Here's how privacy works in Speak for Me:

- Suggestions are delivered as ephemeral messages — they automatically disappear and are only visible to you
- Your message data is encrypted with AES-256 (same as banks)
- We don't store your message content after generating the suggestion
- Fully GDPR compliant with EU data hosting

Your colleagues see a perfectly crafted response. They don't see the AI that helped you write it.

That's not cheating. That's working smarter.

- Your communication style preferences

And delivers a response only you can see.

Three trigger options:
1. @mention the bot
2. /speakforme-watch a channel
3. Right-click → "Help me respond"

Pick your style. Get results.

**Caption:**
```
Real scenario:

Client message: "This is the third time the deliverable has been late. I'm starting to question whether this partnership is working."

Your gut reaction: panic. Defensive explanation. Blame the team.

Speak for Me's suggestion: "Sarah, I hear your frustration and take full responsibility for the delays. Here's what's changed: [specific actions]. I'd like to schedule a 15-minute call to walk through our updated process — would Thursday work?"

Why this works:
- Acknowledges without deflecting
- Takes ownership immediately
- Shifts to action (not excuses)
- Proposes a concrete next step

This is what context-aware AI does. It applies communication best practices you know but forget under pressure.

Let's talk numbers.

93% of professionals say they've struggled with how to respond to a difficult workplace message.

The average person spends 12+ minutes crafting a response to a tricky message.

If you get 5 of those a week, that's an hour lost to anxiety and rewrites.

Speak for Me gives you that hour back.

AI-generated suggestions in under 10 seconds. Context-aware. Style-matched. Private.

One hour per week. 52 hours per year. That's more than a full work week — reclaimed.

#### Day 19 (Friday) — "Communication Styles Guide"

Educational carousel-style graphic on warm cream (#FFFDF7). Title: "4 communication styles in Slack (and how to handle each)" with brushstroke underline. Four quadrants: "The Direct One" (lightning bolt, blue), "The Passive-Aggressive One" (mask, coral), "The Over-Explainer" (speech bubbles, purple), "The One-Worder" (ellipsis, gray). Each with a brief one-line description. Bottom: "Speak for Me adapts to all of them." Shareable, save-worthy.
```

**Story Image Prompt (1080x1920):**
```
Vertical guide on warm cream. "Which one are YOU?" at top. Four personality cards stacked: "The Direct One — 'Done. Next?'" "The Passive-Aggressive — 'As per my previous message...'" "The Over-Explainer — writes a novel for a yes/no question" "The One-Worder — 'k'." Each with unique color accent. Fun, self-identifying. "Tag someone who's The Passive-Aggressive one" at bottom.
```

**Caption:**
```
Everyone on your Slack team fits one of these:

The Direct One: "Done. What's next?"
Efficient but sometimes comes across as cold. Needs: softening.

The Passive-Aggressive: "As per my previous message..."
Says one thing, means another. Needs: clarity and directness.

The Over-Explainer: Writes 4 paragraphs for a yes/no question.
Thorough but overwhelming. Needs: conciseness.

The One-Worder: "k"
Impossible to read. Is it fine? Are they mad? Needs: context.

Speak for Me handles responses TO all of them — and adapts its style to match YOUR communication preferences.

Tag someone who's definitely The Passive-Aggressive one.

Save this for your team's next communication debate.

```

**Caption:**
```
Week 3 update — building Speak for Me in public.

Shipped:
- Style learning improvements
- Applied to Slack App Directory
- Response quality optimizations

Learned:
- The "refine" feature is what makes people stick
- Client-facing teams are our strongest use case
- Word of mouth starts slow but compounds

Honest moment:
Building from zero is a grind. No audience. No viral moment. Just showing up every day, shipping, and telling people about it.

But every new install is someone who trusted us with their communication. That matters.

More next week.

Average difficult messages per week: 5
Weekly time lost: 1 hour
Annual time lost: 50 hours
At $75/hr loaded cost: $3,750 per employee, per year

For a team of 10? That's $37,500/year spent on overthinking Slack messages.

Speak for Me is free to install.

The ROI is obvious. The real question is why you're still doing it manually.

Scenario on warm cream (#FFFDF7). Slack message from "Jordan (PM)": "Hey, can we also add the analytics dashboard to this sprint? The client mentioned it yesterday." AI suggestion below in blue-indigo: "I'd love to include that — let me scope the effort first. Adding it to this sprint would push the launch date by about a week.

**Story Image Prompt (1080x1920):**

```

**Caption:**
```
The scope creep message just dropped:

"Hey, can we also add the analytics dashboard to this sprint? The client mentioned it yesterday."

Your gut reaction: Absolutely not. We're already behind.

But you can't say that.

Speak for Me's suggestion:
"I'd love to include that — let me scope the effort first. Adding it to this sprint would push the launch date by about a week. Want me to put together a quick estimate so we can decide together?"

Why this works:
- Doesn't say no (keeps the door open)
- Quantifies the trade-off (a week)
- Puts the decision back on them
- Stays collaborative

This is what AI-assisted communication looks like. Not robotic. Strategic.

```

**Caption:**
```
Saying no at work is a skill most people never master.

Here are 4 frameworks that work in Slack:

1. The Redirect
"I can't take this on, but I can [alternative]. Would that work?"

2. The Boundary
"I'd love to, but my bandwidth is committed through [date]. Can we revisit then?"

3. The Deflect
"Great idea — I think [name] has the context to run with this. Want me to loop them in?"

4. The Trade-off
"I can absolutely do this if we deprioritize [other thing]. Which matters more right now?"

Every one of these maintains the relationship while protecting your time.

And yes — Speak for Me suggests responses exactly like these. Automatically.

Save this. You'll need it.

30 days of building Speak for Me in public.

The wins:
- [X] workspaces using the app
- [X] suggestions generated
- Applied to Slack App Directory
- Started this Instagram from zero
- Real humans finding real value in the product

The honest parts:
- Growth is slower than you want it to be
- Not every feature lands how you expect
- Building alone means wearing every hat
- Some days you wonder if anyone cares

But then someone messages saying "this saved me 20 minutes on a message I was dreading" and it all makes sense again.

Month 2 goal: Slack App Directory listing + Product Hunt prep.

Thanks for following along.

## Image Generation Commands

To generate each image, use the nano-banana-pro skill:

```bash
# Feed post (3:4 ratio — use 4K resolution)
uv run .claude/skills/nano-banana-pro/scripts/generate_image.py \
  --prompt "[FEED POST PROMPT FROM ABOVE]" \
  --filename "campaign/day-XX-feed.png" \
  --resolution 4K

# Story (9:16 ratio — use 4K resolution)
uv run .claude/skills/nano-banana-pro/scripts/generate_image.py \
  --prompt "[STORY PROMPT FROM ABOVE]" \
  --filename "campaign/day-XX-story.png" \
  --resolution 4K
```

Note: Gemini generates square/landscape by default. For 9:16 Stories, include "vertical format, 9:16 aspect ratio" in the prompt. For 3:4 feed posts, include "3:4 portrait aspect ratio" in the prompt.

## Campaign Effectiveness Checklist

### Before Launch
- [ ] Instagram Business account created (@speakformeapp)
- [ ] Bio optimized with CTA link (speakforme.app)
- [ ] Profile picture: Speak for Me logo (320x320)
- [ ] Meta Ads Manager account set up
- [ ] Meta Pixel installed on speakforme.app
- [ ] Conversion events configured (install button click, email signup)
- [ ] Content scheduled in batch (use Later, Buffer, or Meta Business Suite)
- [ ] Ad audiences created and saved
- [ ] UTM parameters set up for link tracking (e.g., ?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=awareness)

### Weekly Review
- [ ] Check Instagram Insights: reach, engagement rate, saves, shares
- [ ] Review ad performance: CTR, CPC, conversions
- [ ] Kill underperforming ads (CTR < 0.8%)
- [ ] Scale winning ads (+20% budget)
- [ ] Note which content pillar performed best
- [ ] Respond to all comments and DMs within 24 hours
- [ ] Update build-in-public metrics for Saturday post

### KPIs to Track

| Metric | Week 1 Target | Week 4 Target |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Followers | 50 | 300+ |
| Avg engagement rate | 3%+ | 5%+ |
| Profile visits/week | 100 | 500+ |
| Website clicks/week | 20 | 100+ |
| Email signups from IG | 5 | 30+ |
| App installs from IG | 2 | 15+ |
| Ad CTR | 1.0%+ | 1.5%+ |
| Ad CPC | <$3.50 | <$2.50 |

### Content Performance Signals
- **Saves** = content is valuable (educational posts)
- **Shares/Sends** = content is relatable (pain point, meme-adjacent)
- **Comments** = content is engaging (engagement posts, polls)
- **Profile visits** = content drives curiosity (feature, social proof)

Prioritize content types that drive saves and shares — these are Instagram's top-weighted algorithm signals in 2026.

---

## Cross-Posting Strategy

Each Instagram post should be adapted for:

| Platform | Adaptation |
|----------|-----------|
| **LinkedIn** | Longer, more professional caption. Remove hashtags. Add personal story angle. Tag relevant connections. |
| **X / Twitter** | Shorten to 280 chars or thread format. Use 1-2 hashtags max. More conversational tone. |
| **Instagram Stories** | Use the Story image variant. Add poll/question stickers for engagement. |

Post to Instagram first (primary), then adapt within 1-2 hours for other platforms.
