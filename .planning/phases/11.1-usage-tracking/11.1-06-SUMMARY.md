## Human Verification Checkpoint

This is a manual verification checkpoint for the usage tracking system. All automated plans (01-05) have been completed successfully.

### What to Verify

1. Navigate to `/dashboard/usage` — verify progress bar, usage stats, billing period info
2. Check pricing page — verify each plan shows included suggestions
3. Navigate to `/admin/usage` (as admin) — verify org-wide usage summary and per-user table
4. Check sidebar — verify "Usage" link in both main nav and admin section
5. Review Slack suggestion messages — verify usage footer appears
6. Test near-limit behavior — verify warning alerts
7. Verify free-tier hard cap at 100%
8. Verify paid plans allow overage

### Status

Deferred — user can verify at their convenience after deployment.
