  <what-built>
    Complete usage tracking and enforcement system:
    1. Database schema extended with Stripe tracking columns
    2. Usage enforcement with atomic increments and tiered warnings
    3. AI generation pipeline checks usage before generation, records after
    4. Slack ephemeral messages include usage footer with warning levels
    5. User-facing usage dashboard at /dashboard/usage
    6. Stripe Billing Meters integration with daily batch reporting
    7. Admin usage analytics at /admin/usage
    8. Pricing page shows included suggestions per plan
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Navigate to /dashboard/usage - verify progress bar, usage stats, and billing period info display
    2. Check the pricing page - verify each plan shows included suggestions count
    3. Navigate to /admin/usage (as admin) - verify org-wide usage summary and per-user table
    4. Check sidebar navigation - verify "Usage" link appears in main nav and admin section
    5. Review Slack suggestion messages - verify usage count footer appears
    6. If possible, test with a near-limit usage count to verify warning alerts appear
    7. Verify free-tier hard cap: when at 100%, next suggestion attempt shows limit message
    8. Check that paid plans allow overage (no hard block)
