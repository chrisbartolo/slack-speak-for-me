    Write 4 admin documentation articles. Each MUST have frontmatter with `title`, `description`, `category: "admin"`, and `order`. Use Callout and Step components.

    - Reference web portal navigation paths (Dashboard > Settings > ...)
    - Cross-reference related articles
    - Target 250-400 words per article

    - All articles render with prose styling, Callout/Step components work

  <action>
    Write 5 documentation articles covering troubleshooting, API, and FAQ. Each MUST have frontmatter.

    **Troubleshooting (category: "troubleshooting"):**

    1. `troubleshooting/common-issues.mdx` (order: 1) - "Common Issues"
       - "Bot is not responding to messages" -> check /watch status, verify channel permissions
       - "Suggestions are not personalized" -> check style settings, grant message history access
       - "Cannot see ephemeral messages" -> explain ephemeral message limitations (only visible to recipient, disappear on reload)
       - "Reports not generating" -> check Google Sheets connection, verify workflow channel
       - Format: Problem/Solution pairs with clear headings
       - Callout tip for each resolution

    2. `troubleshooting/permissions.mdx` (order: 2) - "Slack Permissions"
       - Required Slack permissions and what each does
       - Table: permission -> purpose (e.g., channels:history -> read messages for context)
       - Common permission errors and how to fix them
       - Re-installing the app to update permissions
       - Callout warning: changing permissions requires re-install

    3. `troubleshooting/billing-issues.mdx` (order: 3) - "Billing Issues"
       - Payment failed: what happens (Stripe retries, past_due access continues)
       - Subscription expired: how to resubscribe
       - Trial ended: upgrade options
       - Wrong plan: how to change plans via Customer Portal
       - Refund requests: contact info
       - Link to admin/billing for general billing docs

    **API & Integrations (category: "api"):**

    4. `api/integration.mdx` (order: 1) - "API & Integrations"
       - Slack app permissions overview (what the app needs and why)
       - Google Sheets integration setup (step-by-step with Step components)
       - OAuth flow explanation (simplified, user-facing)
       - Data flow: Slack message -> AI -> ephemeral response
       - Callout info: all data encrypted in transit and at rest
       - This is a user-facing overview, NOT a developer API reference

    **FAQ (top-level, no category subfolder):**

    5. `faq.mdx` (category: "faq", order: 1) - "Frequently Asked Questions"
       - Organize into sections: General, Features, Billing, Privacy, Troubleshooting
       - 15-20 questions covering:
         - General: What is Speak for Me? Who is it for? How does the AI work?
         - Features: Can others see my suggestions? Does it work in DMs? Can I use it in multiple workspaces?
         - Billing: Is there a free trial? Can I cancel anytime? Individual vs team pricing?
         - Privacy: What data is collected? Can I delete my data? Is my data shared?
         - Troubleshooting: Why am I not getting suggestions? How do I reset my style?
       - Use h2 for sections, h3 for each question
       - Keep answers concise (2-3 sentences each)
       - Link to detailed articles where appropriate

    NOTE: The _meta.ts from Plan 01 does not have a "faq" category. The FAQ article can use category: "faq" and order: 99 -- update _meta.ts to add an FAQ entry: `{ slug: 'faq', title: 'FAQ', order: 6 }`. Since faq.mdx is at the root of content/docs/ (not in a subfolder), the content.ts should handle root-level MDX files. If it only walks subdirectories, the executor should update content.ts to also check root-level .mdx files.

    **Content guidelines:**
    - Troubleshooting: problem-solution format, scannable
    - FAQ: concise answers, link to full articles
    - API: user-facing, not developer-facing
    - Cross-reference articles in all content
    - Target 200-400 words per article (FAQ can be longer due to many questions)
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `npm run build --workspace=web-portal` succeeds
    - Navigate to each article:

      - /docs/troubleshooting/permissions

      - /docs/faq
    - All articles render with correct styling
    - Sidebar shows Troubleshooting and API sections
    - FAQ is accessible and shows all question categories
    - Cross-reference links work between articles
  </verify>
  <done>
    All remaining documentation content written. Troubleshooting (3 articles), API (1 article), and FAQ (1 comprehensive article with 15+ questions). All articles render correctly and cross-reference each other.
