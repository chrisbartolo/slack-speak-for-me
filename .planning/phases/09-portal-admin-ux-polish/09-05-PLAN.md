  <how-to-verify>
**Start the development server:**
```bash
cd /Users/christopherbartolo/Documents/GitHub/slack-speak-for-me/apps/web-portal && npm run dev
```

**Desktop Testing (browser width >= 768px):**
1. Visit http://localhost:3001/dashboard
2. Verify warm cream background color is visible
3. Hover over any card - should lift slightly with shadow
4. Check sidebar - should be visible on left side
5. If admin, click "Admin" in sidebar - should expand to show Organizations, Users, Billing
6. Click Admin again - should collapse
7. Navigate between pages and observe loading skeleton briefly

**Mobile Testing (browser width < 768px):**
1. Resize browser to mobile width (< 768px) or use DevTools responsive mode
2. Sidebar should disappear, hamburger menu should appear in top-left
3. Tap hamburger menu - drawer should slide in from left with full navigation
4. Tap outside drawer - should close
5. Navigate to a page from drawer - drawer should close and page should load

**Gradient Button Testing:**
1. Look for any primary CTA buttons using the gradient variant
2. If none visible, temporarily add one in a page to verify:
   - Gradient from blue to indigo
   - Slight lift on hover
   - Smooth transition

**Error Boundary Testing (optional):**
1. This requires simulating an error - can skip if confident
